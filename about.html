                                <p>We strongly support spay/neutering of all non-show quality companion animals
                                    prior to any litters.</p>

                                <p>We believe pets should go to screened homes only and be spayed/neutered prior
                                    to adoption.

                                <p>We applaud and support the efforts of rescue groups, breed clubs, and kennel
                                    clubs working towards these same goals.

                                <p>We oppose the sale of live animals in pet stores and applaud those who have
                                    already opted to show only shelter pets in their stores.

                                <p>We oppose purchasing purebreds from back yard breeders, puppy mills, or anyone
                                    who breeds for any purpose other than to better the breed.<br><br><br>

                                <p class="col-md-4">Ron and I  began as volunteers for the Lewis &amp; Clark Humane Society in Helena,
                                    Montana in the fall of 1993.  We started by designing and implementing software
                                    for use in lost and found which was tremendously successful, having increased the
                                    owner located rates on stray dogs from 25% to the 70’s% and stray cats from near
                                    0% to approximately 13%.  From there, we expanded that software to include an
                                    animal waiting list which we also maintained daily.  Next we computerized the
                                    animal census lists into "resident lists" to be used for advertising the animals.
                                    These were posted in seventy local businesses around town regularly.  This was so
                                    successful in increasing adoptions that we began networking with other cities and
                                    shelters, making use of volunteers in other towns surrounding Helena, to also
                                    post our census sheets there. As of April 1998, more than one fourth of our
                                    adoptions were going to locations more than thirty miles from the shelter. I also
                                    wrote the Independent Record "Pickapet" ads since their inception.</p>

                                <p class="col-md-4">We began talking about creating a webpage for the Lewis &amp; Clark Humane Society
                                    several years ago.  Eventually we, together with three other local people put
                                    that plan into action. Ron and I designed, implemented, and maintained a large
                                    portion of the webpage for ten months on a daily basis that included the Lewis
                                    &amp; Clark Humane Society’s total census with pictures, including follow up stories
                                    of all pets leaving the shelter each day. We had many emails from people asking
                                    how they could help a particular animal, thus came the Guardian Angel Program
                                    which allowed people to sponsor the pet of their choice on the webpage with
                                    credit given to them under the animal's picture.  We were surprised at the
                                    number of inquiries about long distance adoptions, so we reached out to the
                                    community to help make that possible and the response was overwhelming. The
                                    Independent Record donated the "ride needed" ads and participation from the
                                    local travel agents helped more than twenty shelter dogs get to screened,
                                    loving homes in other states.</p>

                                <div class="col-md-4">
                                <p>From there we went on to add a link to the other Montana shelters and featured
                                    some of their available pets on our site.  This was so successful, that in ten
                                    months time, more than three thousand people were viewing the Lewis &amp; Clark Humane
                                    Society webpage each month.  In April of 1998, Ron and I decided that we were ready
                                    for new challenges so we stepped down as webmasters for the Lewis &amp; Clark Humane
                                    Society, in order to start this page with the ultimate goal of having one page
                                    from which people could link to all the Montana shelters and humane societies.</p>

                                <p>Our plan is to expand the same format and writing style the public has enjoyed
                                    those ten months on the Lewis &amp; Clark Humane Society webpage to as many of the
                                    other Montana shelters who have requested us as time allows. It will be updated
                                    daily in the same manner as we did before. We hope you enjoy it and welcome your
                                    feedback.</p><br><br><br><br>
